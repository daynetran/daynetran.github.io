**E-Commerce Research (in progress)** Since July 2020, as part of a three-person team, I have
been developing a full-stack service in order to help companies
optimize their e-commerce research. We web-crawl hundreds of links to product
sites from Amazon to Home Depot. We then compile all data (titles, prices, shipping dates, descriptions, etc.)
into an easily-readable csv file, automating away many man-hours of research into competitors' products and markets.
As of August, we have already completed the web scrapers and can compile the data.
Our last steps are to plug the scrapers into a Django framework, hook the site onto a server,
and optimize the user-graphical interface.

**[Personal Website: daynetran.github.io](https://daynetran.github.io)**
In August 2020, I built this website to share my experiences and
passion projects, as well as my thoughts about various books/papers/articles.
This site is where I process, ruminate over, and then relay ideas and concepts usually
pertaining to either economics, computer science, or both. The site is hosted by GitHub Pages and powered by a static
site generator called Jekyll. For the front-end, I learned how
to use HTML, CSS, and Markdown to beautify and organize the design. For the back end, I was introduced to
Ruby and its gem-system, and I also used Git to commit and push from my local to remote repositories.
