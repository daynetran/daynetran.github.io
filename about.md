Heyooo! I'm Dayne, and thank you for coming here, to my little corner of the world wide web. I hail from SoCal, but I've been calling NorCal home for the past 4 years. I'm about to be a senior at UC Berkeley, and I'm studying both economics and computer science (I know, I know, I sold out, *sheepish shrug*).

When I'm not finishing my coding projects at 2am at Soda Hall or dozing off in my behavioral economics lectures, I'm doing a lot of other stuff! During the school year, I work 2 jobs: equipment manager for the [Cal Football Team](https://www.instagram.com/cal_football/) and peer advisor for the [Berkeley econ department](https://www.instagram.com/cal_econadvising/). In whatever free time I have left, I volunteer for [Cal Habitat for Humanity](https://www.calhabitat.org/) and play *way too much* basketball.

Alright, I'm done with the autobiographical schpiel. This site serves two purposes. First, I hope that this body of work serves a time capsule where 20 years from now, I can look back at my work here proudly. Second, I want to record my thoughts on everything that goes on in my life. I want to write satirical commentary, fictional prose, ruminations on books I'm reading, and so much more.
