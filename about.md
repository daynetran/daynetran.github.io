My name is `Dayne Tran`, and I'm a second-year undergrad `Econ + CS` student at U.C. Berkeley.

I created this site because I wanted to find a personal place where I can jot down my thoughts
on whatever it is that I'm learning about.  At this little corner of the Web, you can find my projects, blogs, reviews, and more. If you want to get in touch, email me at `dayne.tran@berkeley.edu`.
