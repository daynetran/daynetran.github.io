*Why We Sleep* is not just any book that you just pick up and learn some lessons
from. It's an education on a fundamental process that we spend roughly 33% of
how many x years we live doing: zzzzzzz's.

Written by Berkeley psychology professor Matthew Walker, the book is a thorough
analysis of the biological forces that drive sleep, and Walker throws at his
readers heaps of evidence and arguments on how vital it is that we sleep the
right amount, the right way.

Especially in our modern society, humans strongly undervalue the importance of
sleep. Whether its an addiction to caffeinated beverages, staying up late to
binge a show or grind out a video game, or a systemic presence of too-early
school-start schedules, we as a society are suffering, according to Walker, from
a sleep-deprivation epidemic.

I really appreciated that Walker started first with the underlying biochemical
processes from which sleep is created. For instance, I originally thought that
sleep is driven solely by the circadian rhythm. However, I learned that
circadian rhythm is but one of two driving forces. There is also a chemical
substance that builds up in the brain the every single waking moment, creating a
"sleep pressure" that simultaneously turns down the "volume" of wake-promoting
regions in the brain and turns up the dial on sleep-inducing regions. This
chemical is called adenosine. It only subsides when you sleep, and fun facts (1)
adenosine from triggering sleepiness and (2) adenosine has no relation
whatsoever to the circadian rhythm (but the larger the distance between the two
in concentration, the greater your sleep desire --> high amounts of adenosine
and a low circadian rhythm means hard crash).

The driving factor that can be traced in all of the following negative effects
of sleep deprivation is the over-activation of the sympathetic system (a.k.a.
flight-or-fight). Staying awake to survive is not only logical, but has been
proven over and over in studies and through evolution. But when we deprive
ourselves of sleep for no good reason, over long stretches of time, chronically,
our body spends too much time in this aggressive state and begins to
self-destruct in several ways (see increased cancer and heart disease risks).

Beyond the science (of which I shared only a snippet) behind sleep, Walker also
spends a great deal of time discussing the consequences of low sleep. Humans are
terrible at short-term-positive, long-term-negative decision-making (thanks,
*Nudge*.) So here's a list of long-term consequences that results from chronic
poor sleep that you won't necessarily realize when you're staying watching that
next YouTube video or Netflix episode:
- Weakened immune system
- Double the risk of cancer
- Possible links to Alzheimer's
- Increased likelihood of blocked arteries, cardiovascular disease, and stroke

Walker also delves into the short-term and medium-term effects.

Let's first consider weight gain and metabolism. First, the less you sleep, the
more likely you are to eat: poor sleep decreases the concentration of leptin and
increases levels of ghrelin (the two hormones that control appetite, leptin
makes you feel full and ghrelin makes you feel hungry.) This double jeopardy
increases our hunger and appetite. Sleep deprivation also silences supervisory
regions in the prefrontal cortex required for controlled decisions and
thoughtful judgements.

Second, sleep is a key component in fighting infection and sickness. When we
fall ill, the immune system actively stimulates the sleep system. Removing sleep
hours weakens the immune system. That means more than just having a higher
chance of catching a cold. That means a higher chance of getting cancer.
Returning to the aggressive symptoms of a hyper-driven sympathetic state, tumors
use inflammation to help further damage and mutate the DNA of their cancer
cells, increasing the tumor's potency. This is also a double jeopardy, as immune
cells are weaker and less plentiful, while tumors ride inflammation waves to
become stronger.

*Why We Sleep* offers a powerful warning against chronic sleep deprivation.
