Wow, I'm excited to be launching this feature of my blog! Finger On the Pulse is
a weekly post that will surmise all the little and big things that I've consumed
in the past week - movies, shows, books, food, opinion pieces, music. One of
each a week! This has been heavily inspired by Kareem Abdul Jabbar's Substack
series Weekend Boost, and I figured sharing my thoughts in a similar fashion is
a good way to build a habit of blogging.

Alright, let's get started (Wooooo!!!).

# **Movie: Hustle**

*Hustle*, which just arrived on
[Netflix](https://www.netflix.com/title/80242342), might be Hollywood's largest
loveletter to the sport of basketball. Can an underdog and dark horse, coached
by a grizzled mentor about basketball and life lessons, overcome his personal
doubt and insecurities and fulfill his potential? Yes, some story beats lean too
much into "sports movies" tropes; however, it is still heartwarming to see Adam
Sandler's and Juan Hermangomez's characters build a close relationship, and the
scenes of basketball gameplay are exciting to see. 

For basketball fans, there is so many easter eggs to see. There is an
overwhelming abudance of NBA current players, former players, coaches, general
managers, and more. I won't spoil names. But seeing a personality flit in and
out of a scene and trying to name them as quickly as possible as my brother and
I watched ("OOOOOOH, was that xxx??") wws a fun game to play. And beyond
cameos, several players acted as characters that were critical to the story; it
was very fun to see these basketball figures, whose personalities are already
public and well-known, break their mold and act as a very different type of
person.

# **Television: The Boys (Season 3)** #

**CONTENT WARNING** This show is simply outrageous. Like excessively outrageous.
Like they make it a point to be the most insane, bloody, make-you-say-the-fuck
show on television?. Think of the Deadpool franchise, but a bar of notoriety
above it. The first scene is the worst of the bunch, but thankfully (so far! as
of this writing, only 4 episodes are out) the level of vulgarity declines. Okay,
on with the review...

The third season of *The Boys* has dropped on [Amazon
Prime](https://www.amazon.com/gp/video/detail/B09WV8HF7Q/?ref=dvm_us_dl_sl_go_ast_20BOY_mkw_sC0pXM8Le-dc&mrntrk=pcrid_600000196212_slid__pgrid_69899139035_pgeo_9032083_x__ptid_kwd-692258484849&gclid=Cj0KCQjw-pCVBhCFARIsAGMxhAfwjy_3LkBndwJ-PxeXETCOgn4p-5JVdYNko_V3lC2UChh6G2RpvTQaAg77EALw_wcB)
and boy oh boy, it is simply, in Billy Butcher's words, *fucking diabolical*.
The writers have found their groove, and their story boasts an ambitious yet
tight scope of narrative. The large cast is dynamic and on-point, and their
characters are fully fleshed out and ready for balls-to-the-wall action. 

There are two differentiators that push The Boys to the upper echelon of current
television. First is the **SATIRE**. Whether big or small, there are moments
that absolutely deride today's political systems and cultural constructs. They
absolute **S M A C K**; they are hard-hitting but they also don't throw sand
over the line. The second is **HOMELANDER**. The greatest supervillain in
superhero media today, is abso-fucking-lutely insane this season. Anthony Star
*has* to be in consideration for awards this year, because he delivers an
absolute masterclass performance. Almost every scene of his invokes fear and
terror. He is bulletproof yet deeply insecure, he can lift buses but falls apart
when facing his corporate boss, and he is scoffs down on humanity because of
superhuman powers but his flawed characteristics make him incredibly human
(well, minus the psychopathic traits).

We've reached the halfway point of the season, and I'll probably write another
review once the season concludes. Right now, I'm pulling for Frenchie/Kimiko and
Mother's Milk. But this season has strong "careful-what-you-wish-for" vibes, and
many of the other characters are making decisions that I predict they will very
soon regret. I'm excited to see where it goes, and I hope to see that you are as
well.

# **Music: Mr. Morale & The Big Steppers - Kendrick Lamar** 
<img src="/assets/images/finger_on_the_pulse/music/Kendrick-Lamar-Mr-Morale-And-The-Big-Steppers.webp"
    width="600" class="center"/>

This is a long time coming. Kendrick Lamar has emerged from a hiatus to publish
a much anticipated new album. And...my feelings are mixed. After listening to
this 1 hr and 18 min album, here are my thoughts. First, Kendrick Lamar is still
top in lyrical abilities, bar none. I spent hours chewing on the wordplay in
this album, because his talent in this area is just *that good*. Second, the
repeatability of many of the songs comes from a top-notch, first-grade
production quality. The producers for this album did an amazing job. Check out
Rich-Interlude, because the piano piece goes hard. 

There are aspects of the album that I did not like, concerning some of
the topics he talked aobut.  There are several songs that I love listening to
over and over again; songs like N95 and Die Hard are amazing in every sense. But
there are others that are hard to listen to. For example, the topic of Worldwide
Steppers is uncomfortable, to say the least. Therapy is a recurrent theme, and I
feel like Kendrick is more honest in this album, even if it means sharing
some flawed beliefs that he had in the past or may even still carry
today.

At the end of the day, Kendrick Lamar is still king of rap (in my opinion).
Check out this album, it's worth an entire listen. I personally enjoyed We Cry
Together, N95, Father Time. Here it is on
[Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/album/1atjqOZTCdrjxjMyCPZc2g).
