We’ve all felt it. We arrive in Berkeley, the world’s greatest public university
and historical home-stay for political activism, scientific breakthroughs, and
cultural significance. And we feel a deep yearning to contribute to her
legacy…how naive and stupid of us!

You see, the real joy is slaving for hours (unpaid) on some PowerPoint pitch
deck for some third-rate company who, upon deliberating upon what to do with
their lowest-priority project, decides to do away with their employee costs and
throw it onto some put-up-with-bullshit, apparently-got-nothing-better-to-do
Berkeley students for free!

That’s the kind of joy that drives thousands of Berkeley students, every
semester, to apply to Berkeley Consulting, Net Impact, and all the other
spin-offs of the same thing. And its so fricking hard to get into these clubs.
While the hottest, most-desirable clubs in Miami, SF, or Los Angeles have
banging music, flashing lights, and people sweaty from dancing away their
troubles, for whatever reason, the hottest clubs in Berkeley also have sweaty
people and that’s it.

And that’s why we introduce Alpha Sigma Sigma (ASS), Berkeley’s first
pre-Consulting-Club Fraternity. We are going to help you get into the consulting
club of your corporate dreams.
