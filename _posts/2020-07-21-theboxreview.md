 Although my economics professor (the amazing intellect that is Christina Romer) recommended this novel in March, I only got around to reading *The Box*, by Marc Levinson, three months later in June. Per the title, the book is all about the origins and rise of the cargo container. Levinson details how the unromantic, almost-humbling 4x4 sheets of metal shook awoke the sleepy institutions of the transportation industry, spawned a decades-long chess match between hungry entrepreneurs, and laid the foundation upon which globalization in late-1900s and early-2000s took off like a rocket.
 As a reader, I greatly enjoyed
