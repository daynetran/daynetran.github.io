 In March, my Intro to Economics professor (the amazing Christina Romer) recommended *The Box* as an immersive introduction to economics. I got around to reading it three months later. I wish I picked it up earlier.

 Per the title, this book is about the origins and rise of the cargo container. This book is long and detailed. To give you some sense of its length, I'll just say that my kindle told me that Levinson's closing remarks ends barely over the halfway point... the other roughly 40% is his citations and notes! But, if you stick with it, *The Box* is a treasure trove of economic information and analysis. There's something for everyone: riveting tales of entrepreneurialism, an ingenious insight involving economies of scale, the deterioration of long-established labor markets and its replacement in automation, the booms in places around the world with previously-hidden comparative advantages and the busts where others were not as fortunate. Levinson turns every stone that lies in the story of the cargo container.

 While I reflect on the novel, I have come to believe that its full title is misleading. It isn't just about how the container made the world smaller and the economy better. That's just too rosy of a picture. The title omits how Levinson dedicated many chapters to establishing the many ways in which the old order of the transportation world chose to respond to an invading technology, and he spent as many pages detailing the different causes behind why they were ultimately replaced by this metal box. Some chose to live in ignorance, others tried to work together with the cargo containers. But in my opinion, the cargo container didn't spare many. The cargo container erased the livelihoods of longshoremen and their free-spirited, independent, routine-less days. It wiped out New York's bustling port economy and decimated their unions. On the two coasts, the long-standing American establishment approached the new changes differently, and they would either cease to exist or become a shadow. Even the creators of the cargo box, Malcolm McLean, who at first dominated the burgeoning cargo industry, left the industry, bankrupt. I think this is because the cargo container is one of a handful of inventions that moved the plate tectonics of our entire world. Few technologies, ever, have moved the entire world, and the cargo container is undeniably one of them. The magnitude of the cargo's effects meant that the only constant in this new world is change, and many of the transportation industry's predecessors could not hold on.

It may be hard to appreciate today how revolutionary the cargo container truly is. Global supply chains are the norm, and we can purchase an overabundance of goods from around the world. But back then, sloppy, disorganized deliveries took weeks instead of days, months instead of weeks. Pillaging was rampant, and there was no way to secure your goods. Businesses simply lost too much to ever justify heavily (or even regularly) trading products overseas.

But the "box" is compact, secure, anonymous, and organizeable. This 4x4 slab of steel laid the foundation upon which globalization took off like a rocket. It helped build the world we live in today.
