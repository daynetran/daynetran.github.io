 In March, my economics professor (the amazing intellect that is Christina Romer) recommended *The Box* as an immersive introduction to economics. I only got around to reading it three months later, after the semester ended. I wish I picked it up earlier.

 Per the title, this book is about the origins and rise of the cargo container. Levinson details how this 4x4 slab of steel shook awoke the sleepy institutions of the transportation industry, spawned a international brawl between entrepreneurial-minded groups, and laid the foundation upon which globalization took off like a rocket.

 This book is long and detailed. My kindle tells me that Levinson's closing remarks is barely over the halfway point...because the other roughly 40% is his citations and notes! But, if you stick with it, *The Box* is a treasure trove of economic information and analysis. There's something for everyone: riveting tales of entrepreneurialism, hotly contested international business, the deterioration of long-established labor markets and its replacement in automation, the booms and busts that accompany news of rising fortunes. Levinson turns every stone that lies in the story of the cargo container, and he unbiasedly examines the fallout.

 *The Box*'s message is one of inevitable change and how society responds to it. I believe its full title is misleading; it doesn't capture what Levinson dedicated a large portion of his writing to, the chaos all involved parties endured and the uncertainty they all possessed. The cargo container removed the livelihoods of longshoremen and their romanticized, pseudo-independent, routine-less days. It wiped out New York's port economy and decimated their unions. The original creator of the cargo box, Malcolm McLean, who had quickly jumped into the leading cargo-ship company, retired having lost it all. When the chaos settled, when the rapid rush to capitalize on this new technology that can move goods around the world for the first ever!



It's hard to imagine how revolutionary the cargo container in our age, where global supply chains are long established and we can buy whatever we want from around the world and have it arrive within a week.
