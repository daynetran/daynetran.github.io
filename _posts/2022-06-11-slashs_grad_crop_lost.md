title: Tragic News - 2022 Grad Crop Lost

During the Class of 2022 graduation commencement ceremony, what should have been
a satisfying and unforgettable experience took a turn for the worse. On a hot
sunny day, thousands of seniors crowded the historic California Memorial Stadium
(better known as the FTX Field at California Memorial Stadium). And over the
next hours, one by one, our students fell victim to heat waves in the shadeless
open field.

And that's the tragedy. A fresh crop of students had their poor brains
melted in the sun. We knew that this year's yield was inferior to that of
previous years. Obviously, the past two years of distanced and online learning
meant that their brains were never going to be as ripe or cultivable. Alas,
we also knew a slighltly tarnished product is better than no product.

And yet we were stil failed. Failed by who? The UC Berkeley administration. We
have to call into question the competency of our farmers. Our crops baked to
death in the sun, and our campus administrators failed to prevent it. For the
past twenty years, we've donated so much money so that we can bloat the pockests
of middle-management administrators to prevent anytihing like this from
occurring. So this enormous mistake is incredibly appalling. There will be
repercussions. 

What a shame. We lost an entire year's worth of brilliant 22 year-olds who
could've applied their god-given talents and years of school to making us, the
1%, more money. What a shame the sun got to them.



Sincerely,

Peter Thiel
