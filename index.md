## Hi, I'm Dayne. 
I'm a software engineer from Berkeley, California. I want to build software products that engross,
disrupt, and last. I enjoy building full-stack apps, learning  new languages and frameworks, and
tinkering with big-data datasets. I also love to write, on my [SubStack](https://daynewastaken.substack.com).

Feel free to reach me at [daynetran256@gmail.com](daynetran256@gmail.com). I'd love to talk.

## Education
I graduated with degrees in **Computer Science** and **Economics** from the University of California,
Berkeley in the spring of 2023.

Of the many economics courses I took, I enjoyed **Advanced Econometric Methods and Application, Natural Resource Economics, and Behavioral Economics** the most. My favorite professors are **Jim Campbell, the Romers, and Ben Graham.**

I also enjoyed computer science courses like **Databases, Machine Learning, and Efficient Algorithms and Intractable Problems**. 
I strongly recommend taking courses taught by **Josh Hug, Adi Adhikari, and John DeNero.**

In the summer of 2022, I was a software engineer intern at **Humanitas AI**. I wrote web-scraping **Scrapy** programs, maintained a consumer-facing **Go** app, and created a backend data pipeline in **Python**.

In the summer of 2021, I was a software engineer intern at **Geopogo**. I worked on improving the 
communications and geolocation features of their consumer system written in **C#**.

Throughout my 4 years at **UC Berkeley**, I worked on countless projects relating to databases, artificial 
intelligence, games, economic analysis, statistical analysis, and more. These projects were written in
**Python, Java, C, Assembly, and R**.

## What Else?

I found a love for sports at a very young age that has stayed true to this day. I am an avid basketball 
player, having played competitively in high school and intramurals in college. From the spring of
2022 to the summer of 2023, I was an equipment manager for the football team while studying in 
Berkeley. I worked with the running backs group at practices and was a ball boy at games.

In my free time, I  write and cook, spend time with family, tinker with my NeoVim environment, and lace up my shoes on the basketball court.
